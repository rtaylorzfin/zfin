TODO:
======
- [x] Remove the marker_go_term_evidence rows if needed
- [x] PFAM and PROSITE
- [x] Implement some of the filtering logic for the GO terms in sp_load.sql
    - [x] WITHDRAWN
    - [x] gocheck_do_not_annotate
- [x] Add the marker_go_term_evidence rows for:
    - [x] SPKW2GO
    - [x] EC2GO
    - [x] InterPro2GO
- [x] Remove the marker_go_term_evidence rows for:
    - [x] SPKW2GO
    - [x] EC2GO
    - [x] InterPro2GO
- [x] handle cc load (https://github.com/rtaylorzfin/zfin/blob/zfin-8797/server_apps/data_transfer/SWISS-PROT/sp_load.sql#L452-L452)
- [ ] Add Inference Groups
- [ ] Remove the inference groups if needed
- [ ] Interpro domains??
- [.] clean up names of classes in the code (for example some have "...Interpro..." but actually handle InterPro, EC, etc.) [partially done]
- [ ] Improve the original load diff report to have more info on uniprot probfile entries

### Misc:
- [ ] Add a test for the InterPro2GO
- [ ] Is there a need to handle multiple genes? For example, when loading SPKW2GO, we are going from the uniprot accession to the gene, but what if there are multiple genes for some uniprot accessions?
- [ ] Add a test for comparing the diffs of this load against the current load
- [ ] Make sure we handle zdb_replaced_data
- [ ] Does this line need to be replicated? (--!echo 'unload accession# with no attribution')
- [ ] Do something with ac_dalias.unl ?

### Notes on SPKW2GO:
After implementing a naive version of the spkw2go function, I saw that the logs indicate nothing is getting loaded.
I probably need to do this based on the existing UniProt entries in the DB (not the new actions like EC2GO and InterPro2GO).

#### Completed on 10/24
Note that the SPKW2GO load is now complete.  I had to do a few things to get it to work:
- I had to add a new collection to the context for storing existing marker_go_term_evidence rows so that we know which new ones to add
