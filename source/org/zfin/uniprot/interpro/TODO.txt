======
- [ ] Add the marker_go_term_evidence rows for:
    - [ ] SPKW2GO (partially complete)
    - [x] EC2GO
    - [x] InterPro2GO
- [ ] PFAM and PROSITE?
- [x] Implement some of the filtering logic for the GO terms in sp_load.sql
    - [x] WITHDRAWN
    - [x] gocheck_do_not_annotate
- [ ] Inference Groups
- [x] Remove the marker_go_term_evidence rows if needed
- [ ] Remove the inference groups if needed
- [ ] Interpro domains?
- [ ] handle cc load (https://github.com/rtaylorzfin/zfin/blob/zfin-8797/server_apps/data_transfer/SWISS-PROT/sp_load.sql#L452-L452)
- [ ] clean up names of classes in the code (for example some have "...Interpro..." but actually handle InterPro, EC, etc.

- [ ] SPKW2GO details
After implementing a naive version of the spkw2go function, I saw that the logs indicate nothing is getting loaded.
I probably need to do this based on the existing UniProt entries in the DB (not the new actions like EC2GO and InterPro2GO).
